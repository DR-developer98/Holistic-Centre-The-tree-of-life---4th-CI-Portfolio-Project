<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>When building the landing page for the website, although I had populated the website with the employees by means of a fixture, the employees weren't showing up on the page. This was due to the fact that I had changed the name of the app, but forgot to adapt the model name in the JSON-object. This was fixed by setting the value of "model" to "home.employee".</li>
